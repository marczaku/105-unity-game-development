# Assignment: Small Theft Auto

## Groups
This is a Group Assignment for 4 people per Group.

### Work Schedule
- Workdays 9:00 and 16:00 (or 18:00)

### Work Format
2 Groups of Pair Programming Students (2)
- One Student shares their Screen, and the other discusses how to approach the feature and feedback
- Switch the role of the active (typing) Programmer for each feature, but **at least every 2 hours**!
- There have to be regular commits from **EVERY TEAM MEMBER**
- Team Members without regular contributions will not receive a passing Grade
  
Swap the Pairs every other day, and make sure to work with every single team member of your team!

DO NOT
- Work alone, at your own pace! - You need to learn to communicate and discuss. It's the best way of improving code quality and team quality!
- Stick with the same team members every day! - You should get to know each other and learn, whom it is easier to work with, learn to work with people that might not be so easy to work with and give each other feedback and the chance to improve!
- Commit when everything is perfect! - That's impossible to collaborate with, due to Merge Conflicts!
